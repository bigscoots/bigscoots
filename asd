It seems I do have a Cloudflare account because it was today we disabled Cloudflare in Media Temple.  I never set it up though, and the web person who likely did has changed careers and I no longer have contact with him.
In case this is relevant, below was the issue leading up to the disabling:
The non-www of your site is resolving to the IP of your DV server while the www version is going to CloudFlare:
www.sweetopia.net. 43200 IN CNAME www.sweetopia.net.cdn.cloudflare.net. www.sweetopia.net.cdn.cloudflare.net. 600 IN A 104.18.63.122 www.sweetopia.net.cdn.cloudflare.net. 600 IN A 104.18.62.122
Traffic should be delegated to either your DV directly for both or CloudFlare. If you wish to utilize CloudFlare with an SSL certificate, an upgraded CloudFlare account is necessary or a SSL certificate purchased through CloudFlare.
It is personal preference. CloudFlare allows for more security as traffic is visiting a cached version of the site rather than the actual server but does incur additional cost for an upgraded CloudFlare account.
Regarding the .htaccess rewrite or nginx rules, I'm sorry, I have no idea. The  person who designed my website did  some custom coding, I think though. It's a custom wordpress, I think. I'm very sorry I can't be of help here. ||      ---------> EMAIL DTLS --------->     || Use email on domain? YES || Use third-party email or want to keep it? NO || Wish to move emails to Bigscoots?
