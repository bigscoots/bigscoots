I had created a cloudfare account in the past few months to help my site speed. I didn't realize that Siteground had the ability to set up a Cloudfare account. So I cancelled my subscription with Cloudfare and activated Cloudfare through Siteground.  Hope that makes sense. So this is the account i created first. ||      ---------> EMAIL DTLS --------->     || Use email on domain? YES || Use third-party email or want to keep it? YES ||
